# ðŸ“¹ WebcamMotionDetection and Email Alert System

## Project Overview

This advanced Python application demonstrates proficiency in computer vision, multithreading, and email automation. It uses OpenCV to detect motion in video streams, captures images of detected objects, and sends email alerts with the captured images.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Motion Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV for efficient frame-by-frame analysis
- **Email Alerts**: Automatically sends emails with attached images when motion is detected
- **Multithreading**: Implements threading for non-blocking email sending and folder cleaning
- **Image Processing**: Applies various image processing techniques for accurate motion detection
- **Environment Variable Management**: Uses dotenv for secure handling of sensitive information

## Technical Highlights

- **OpenCV**: Leverages computer vision library for video capture and image processing
- **SMTP**: Implements email functionality using Python's built-in smtplib
- **Threading**: Utilizes Python's threading module for improved performance
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: Used for determining image subtypes
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for email sending process

## Skills Demonstrated

- Advanced Python Programming
- Computer Vision and Image Processing
